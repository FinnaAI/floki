## Introduction

Floki is an AI-native development environment designed for the next evolution of coding. Just as development progressed from punch cards to terminals to text editors to IDEs, Floki represents the next step: a platform built from the ground up for seamless AI-human collaboration.

Traditional IDEs weren't designed with AI integration in mind. Floki creates a new paradigm for working with multiple AI coding agents in parallel, letting you build better software, faster with AI-powered assistance.

## Key Features

- **AI-First Design**: Purpose-built for working with AI coding agents, not just an IDE with AI features added on
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Work with any AI model including OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and more
- **Model Freedom**: Choose any AI provider or model that fits your project needs
- **Crafted Prompts**: Built-in prompts optimized for planning, architecture, and code execution
- **PRD Generator**: Create detailed product requirement documents with AI assistance
- **Task Management**: Manage your coding tasks and delegate to AI agents efficiently

## Philosophy

Floki was created with the belief that the way we write code is fundamentally changing with the rise of AI. Instead of simply adding AI features to existing development environments, we need an entirely new approach.

Our core principles:

1. **AI as a First-Class Citizen**: AI agents are equal partners in the development process
2. **Multiplicity**: Run numerous agents simultaneously, each with different strengths
3. **Human-Centered**: Enhanced productivity without removing human creativity and control
4. **Open Ecosystem**: Support for any model or agent, avoiding vendor lock-in

## Roadmap

- ‚úÖ Core AI integration
- ‚úÖ Multi-model support
- ‚úÖ Prompt engineering for development tasks
- üîÑ Run 10+ agents in parallel
- üîÑ Agent collaboration features
- üîÑ Enhanced testing and debugging with AI
- üîÑ Community-driven prompt library
